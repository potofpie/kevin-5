# Agentuity Chat

## Overview

Agentuity Chat is a web application that allows users to interact with an AI agent. The application is built using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, and it provides a user-friendly interface for chatting with the AI.

It uses the Vercel AI SDK to generate responses from the AI agent, and it includes features such as:

- Message history
- Easily swap AI models and providers with a single line of code
- Lightweight and extensible UI

## Features

The project is a monorepo that includes a Next.js app that serves as the frontend for the Agentuity Chat agent.

The app is built with the following technologies:

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-rendered applications.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for building custom designs.
- **Vercel AI SDK**: A library for interacting with AI models and generating responses.
- **Agentuity**: A platform for creating and managing AI agents.

The web application was bootstrapped with `create-next-app` and includes a custom server setup for handling Chat requests. The agent project was created using the Agentuity cli `agentuity create`.
